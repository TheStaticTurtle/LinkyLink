Everyone want's to see how much power you are actually using, This product is a wireless adapter for the french energy meter (Linky). It's based on an esp8266 which convert the raw data coming from the tele-info port on the linky and displays it in a web page. It also exposes an API for easy integration with a smart home dashboard like home-assistant.

## Disclaimer
- If you don't wire it up correctly or break anything I'm not responsible for any damage that might occur.
- Moreover, you will need a separate power source, unfortunately the alimentation loop isn't powerful enough
## The product
See the datasheet for the installation manual
#### Why did I make it?
I'm a student in computer sciences so I was interested to see how I could decode it and make it more understandable for less technical people and at the same time improve my electrical engineering skill.

#### What makes it special?
It's small and wireless, not everyone wants a big cable running from their meter to their home automation server. It has a beautiful interface:

It's very easy to set up, just connect it to the linky, power it up, connect to its wifi enter the connection detail to your wifi and voila.
**But most importantly it's realtime no waiting for the values to change and you don't have to send all your information to enedis/edf**

#### What's included
Depending on the options you will get the board and a case and ~30cm of cable to connect it to the linky
